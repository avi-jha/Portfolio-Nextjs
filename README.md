This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project can be used as a portfolio project for yourself. Please go through and use it as you will and make it your own. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## For You

Developers can fork this repo and make changes in the data.json file to make this project their own. A piece of advice would be to understand how to design a website so that using json become efficient. You can start to play around with the json file to change the way a few of the portfolio info is displayed. Happy Coding!!ðŸ¤“
